## This the MCp project where we are connected to the external tools

## How to deploy that in Github actions needed:

1. Create a file with name README.md and .gitignore in local.
2. Go and create a repo without readme.md file in github. (Which contains all the repo command instructions that can be used further)
3. First step to add the .env file or venv/ to the .gitignore as the git doesn't track it and push to the github.
4. Second Step write (git init) in the terminal.
5. Third Step write (git add .)
6. Fourth Step write (git commit -m "first commit")
7. Fifth step write (git branch -M main)
8. Sixth step write (git remote add origin https://github.com/yawarsidd/MCP1.git)
9. Seventh step (git push -u origin main)
